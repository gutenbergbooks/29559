<p class="pr1"><big><b>Crane didn't get the nice man's name&mdash;until it
was far too late to do anything at all about it.</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Jack Crane</span> lay all morning in
the vacant lot. Now and then he
moved a little to quiet the protest
of cramped muscles and stagnant
blood, but most of the time he
was as motionless as the heap of
rags he resembled. Not once did
he hear or see a Bohas agent, or,
for that matter, anyone. The predawn
darkness had hidden his
panting flight from the transie
jungle, his dodging across backyards
while whistles shrilled and
voices shouted, and his crawling
on hands and knees down an
alley into the high grass and
bushes which fringed a hidden
garden.</p>

<p>For a while his heart had
knocked so loudly that he had
been sure he would not be able
to hear his pursuers if they did
get close. It seemed inevitable
that they would track him down.
A buddy had told him that a new
camp had just been built at a
place only three hours drive away
from the town. This meant that
Bohas would be thick as hornets
in the neighborhood. But no black
uniforms had so far appeared.
And then, lying there while the
passionate and untiring sun
mounted the sky, the bang-bang
of his heart was replaced by a
noiseless but painful movement
in his stomach.</p>

<p>He munched a candy bar and
two dried rolls which a housewife
had given him the evening before.
The tiger in his belly quit pacing
back and forth; it crouched and
licked its chops, but its tail was
stuck up in his throat. Jack could
feel the dry fur swabbing his
pharynx and mouth. He suffered,
but he was used to that. Night
would come as surely as anything
did. He'd get a drink then to
quench his thirst.</p>

<p>Boredom began to sit on his
eyelids. Just as he was about to
accept some much needed sleep,
he moved a leaf with an accidental
jerk of his hand and uncovered a
caterpillar. It was dark except
for a row of yellow spots along
the central line of some of its segments.
As soon as it was exposed,
it began slowly shimmying away.
Before it had gone two feet, it
was crossed by a moving shadow.
Guiding the shadow was a black
wasp with an orange ring around
the abdomen. It closed the gap
between itself and the worm with
a swift, smooth movement and
straddled the dark body.</p>

<p>Before the wasp could grasp
the thick neck with its mandibles,
the intended victim began rapidly
rolling and unrolling and flinging
itself from side to side. For a
minute the delicate dancer above
it could not succeed in clenching
the neck. Its sharp jaws slid off
the frenziedly jerking skin until
the tiring creature paused for the
chip of a second.</p>

<p>Seizing opportunity and larva
at the same time, the wasp stood
high on its legs and pulled the
worm's front end from the ground,
exposing the yellowed band of the
underpart. The attacker's abdomen
curved beneath its own
body; the stinger jabbed between
two segments of the prey's jointed
length. Instantly, the writhing
stilled. A shudder, and the caterpillar
became as inert as if it were
dead.</p>

<p>Jack had watched with an eye
not completely clinical, feeling the
sympathy of the hunted and the
hounded for a fellow. His own
struggles of the past few months
had been as desperate, though not
as hopeless, and ...</p>

<p>He stopped thinking. His heart
again took up the rib-thudding.
Out of the corner of his left eye
he had seen a shadow that fell
across the garden. When he slowly
turned his head to follow the
stain upon the sun-splashed soil,
he saw that it clung to a pair of
shining black boots.</p>

<p>Jack did not say anything.
What was the use? He put his
hands against the weeds and
pushed his body up. He looked
into the silent mouth of a .38
automatic. It told him his running
days were over. You didn't talk
back to a mouth like that.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Jack was lucky. As one of the
last to be herded into the truck,
which had been once used for
hauling cattle, he had more room
to breathe than most of the others.
He faced the rear bars. The
vehicle was heading into the sun.
Its rays were not as hard on him
as on some of those who were so
jam-packed they could not turn
to get the hot yellow splotch out
of their eyes.</p>

<p>He looked through lowered lids
at the youths on either side of
him. For the last three days in
the transie jungle, the one standing
on his left had given signs of
what was coming upon him, what
had come upon so many of the
transies. The muttering, the indifference
to food, not hearing
you when you talked to him. And
now the shock of being caught in
the raid had speeded up what
everybody had foreseen. He was
hardened, like a concrete statue,
into a half-crouch. His arms were
held in front of him like a praying
mantis', and his hands
clutched a bar. Not even the
pressure of the crowd could break
his posture.</p>

<p>The man on Jack's right murmured
something, but the roaring
of motor and clashing of gears
shifting on a hill squashed his
voice. He spoke louder:</p>

<p>"<i>Cerea flexibilitas</i>. Extreme
catatonic state. The fate of all of
us."</p>

<p>"You're nuts," said Jack. "Not
me. I'm no schizo, and I'm not
going to become one."</p>

<p>As there was no reply, Jack
decided he had not moved his
lips enough to be heard clearly.
Lately, even when it was quiet,
people seemed to have trouble
making out what he was saying.
It made him mildly angry.</p>

<p>He shouted. It did not matter
if he were overheard. That any
of the prisoners were agents of
the Bureau of Health and Sanity
didn't seem likely. Anyway, he
didn't care. They wouldn't do
anything to him they hadn't
planned before this.</p>

<p>"Got any idea where we're
going?"</p>

<p>"Sure. F.M.R.C. 3. Federal
Male Rehabilitation Camp No.
3. I spent two weeks in the
hills spying on it."</p>

<p>Jack looked the speaker over.
Like all those in the truck, he
wore a frayed shirt, a stained and
torn coat, and greasy, dirty
trousers. The black bristles on his
face were long; the back of his
neck was covered by thick curls.
The brim of his dusty hat was
pulled down low. Beneath its
shadow his eyes roamed from side
to side with the same fear that
Jack knew was in his own eyes.</p>

<p>Hunger and sleepless nights
had knobbed his cheekbones and
honed his chin to a sharp point.
An almost visible air clung to
him, a hot aura that seemed to
result from veins full of lava and
eyeballs spilling out a heat that
could not be held within him. He
had the face every transie had, the
face of a man who was either
burning with fever or who had
seen a vision.</p>

<p>Jack looked away to stare miserably
at the dust boiling up behind
the wheels, as if he could see
projected against its yellow-brown
screen his retreating past.</p>

<p>He spoke out of the side of his
mouth. "What's happened to us?
We should be happy and working
at good jobs and sure about the
future. We shouldn't be just
bums, hobos, walkers of the
streets, rod-hoppers, beggars, and
thieves."</p>

<p>His friend shrugged and looked
uneasily from the corners of his
eyes. He was probably expecting
the question they all asked sooner
or later: <i>Why are</i> you <i>on the
road?</i> They asked, but none replied
with words that meant anything.
They lied, and they didn't
seem to take any pleasure in their
lying. When they asked questions
themselves, they knew they
wouldn't get the truth. But something
forced them to keep on trying
anyway.</p>

<p>Jack's buddy evaded also. He
said, "I read a magazine article
by a Dr. Vespa, the head of the
Bureau of Health and Sanity.
He'd written the article just after
the President created the Bureau.
He viewed, quote, with alarm and
apprehension, unquote, the fact
that six percent of those between
the ages of twelve and twenty-five
were schizophrenics who needed
institutionalizing. And he was,
quote, appalled and horrified, unquote,
that five percent of the
nation were homeless unemployed
and that three point seven percent
of those were between the ages of
fourteen and thirty. He said that
if this schizophrenia kept on
progressing, half the world would
be in rehabilitation camps. But
if that occurred, the sane half
would go to pot. Back to the
stone age. And the schizos would
die."</p>

<hr />

<p>He licked his lips as if he were
tasting the figures and found them
bitter.</p>

<p>"I was very interested by
Vespa's reply to a mother who
had written him," he went on.
"Her daughter ended up in a
Bohas camp for schizos, and her
son had left his wonderful home
and brilliant future to become a
bum. She wanted to know why.
Vespa took six long paragraphs
to give six explanations, all equally
valid and all advanced by
equally distinguished sociologists.
He himself favored the mass
hysteria theory. But if you looked
at his gobbledegook closely, you
could reduce it to one phrase,
<i>We don't know</i>.</p>

<p>"He did say this&mdash;though you
won't like it&mdash;that the schizos and
the transies were just two sides
of the same coin. Both were infected
with the same disease,
whatever it was. And the transies
usually ended up as schizos anyway.
It just took them longer."</p>

<p>Gears shifted. The floor slanted.
Jack was shoved hard against the
rear boards by the weight of the
other men. He didn't answer until
the pressure had eased and his
ribs were free to work for more
than mere survival.</p>

<p>He said, "You're way off,
schizo. My hitting the road has
nothing to do with those split-heads.
Nothing, you understand?
There's nothing foggy or dreamy
about me. I wouldn't be here
with you guys if I hadn't been so
interested in a wasp catching a
caterpillar that I never saw the
Bohas sneaking up on me."</p>

<p>While Jack described the little
tragedy, the other allowed an
understanding smile to bend his
lips. He seemed engrossed, however,
and when Jack had finished,
he said:</p>

<p>"That was probably an ammophila
wasp. <i>Sphex urnaria</i>
Klug. Lovely, but vicious, little
she-demon. Injects the poison
from her sting into the caterpillar's
central nerve cord. That
not only paralyzes but preserves
it. The victim is always stowed
away with another one in an
underground burrow. The wasp
attaches one of her eggs to the
body of a worm. When the egg
hatches, the grub eats both of the
worms. They're alive, but they're
completely helpless to resist while
their guts are gnawed away.
Beautiful idea, isn't it?</p>

<p>"It's a habit common to many
of those little devils: <i>Sceliphron
cementarium</i>, <i>Eumenes coarcta</i>,
<i>Eumenes fraterna</i>, <i>Bembix spinolae</i>,
<i>Pelopoeus</i> ..."</p>

<p>Jack's interest wandered. His
informant was evidently one of
those transies who spent long
hours in the libraries. They were
ready at the slightest chance to
offer their encyclopaedic but often
useless knowledge. Jack himself
had abandoned his childhood
bookwormishness. For the last
three years his days and evenings
had worn themselves out on the
streets, passed in a parade of
faces, flickered by in plate-glass
windows of restaurants and department
stores and business
offices, while he hoped, hoped....</p>

<p>"Did you say you spied on the
camp?" Jack interrupted the sonorous,
almost chanting flow of
Greek and Latin.</p>

<p>"Huh? Oh, yeah. For two
weeks. I saw plenty of transies
trucked in, but I never saw any
taken out. Maybe they left in the
rocket."</p>

<p>"Rocket?"</p>

<p>The youth was looking straight
before him. His face was hard as
bone, but his voice trembled.</p>

<p>"Yes. A big one. It landed and
discharged about a dozen men."</p>

<p>"You nuts? There's been only
one man-carrying rocket invented,
and it lands by parachute."</p>

<p>"I saw it, I tell you. And I'm
not so nutty I'm seeing things that
aren't there. Not yet, anyway!"</p>

<p>"Maybe the government's got
rockets it's not telling anybody
about."</p>

<p>"Then what connection could
there be between rehabilitation
camps and rockets?"</p>

<p>Jack shrugged and said, "Your
rocket story is fantastic."</p>

<p>"If somebody had told you
four years ago that you'd be a
bum hauled off to a concentration
camp, you'd have said that was
fantastic too."</p>

<p>Jack did not have time to reply.
The truck stopped outside a high,
barbed wire fence. The gate
swung open; the truck bounced
down the bumpy dirt road. Jack
saw some black-uniformed Bohas
seated by heavy machine guns.
They halted at another entrance;
more barbed wire was passed.
Huge Dobermann pinschers looked
at the transies with cold, steady
eyes. The dust of another section
of road swirled up before
they squeaked to a standstill and
the engine turned off.</p>

<p>This time, agents began to let
down the back of the truck. They
had to pry the pitiful schizo's
fingers loose from the wood with
a crow-bar and carry him off,
still in his half-crouch.</p>

<p>A sergeant boomed orders.
Stiff and stumbling, the transies
jumped off the truck. They were
swiftly lined up into squads and
marched into the enclosure and
from there into a huge black barracks.
Within an hour each man
was stripped, had his head shaven,
was showered, given a grey uniform,
and handed a tin plate and
spoon and cup filled with beans
and bread and hot coffee.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Jack wandered
around, free to look at the sandy
soil underfoot and barbed wire
and the black uniforms of the
sentries, and free to ask himself
where, where, wherewherewhere?
Twelve years ago it had been, but
where, where, where, was...?</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>How easy it would have been
to miss all this, if only he had
obeyed his father. But Mr. Crane
was so ineffectual....</p>

<p>"Jackie," he had said, "would
you please go outside and play,
or stay in some other room. It's
very difficult to discuss business
while you're whooping and
screaming around, and I have a
lot to discuss with Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Daddy," Jack said before
his father mentioned his
visitor's name. But he was not
Jack Crane in his game; he was
Uncas. The big chairs and the
divan were trees in his imaginative
eyes. The huge easy chair in
which Daddy's caller (Jack
thought of him only as "Mister")
sat was a fallen log. He, Uncas,
meant to hide behind it in ambush.</p>

<p>Mister did not bother him. He
had smiled and said in a shrill
voice that he thought Jack was a
very nice boy. He wore a light
grey-green Palm Beach suit and
carried a big brown leather briefcase
that looked too heavy for his
soda straw-thin legs and arms. He
was queer-looking because his
waist was so narrow and his back
so humped. And when he took
off his tan Panama hat, a white
fuzz exploded from his scalp.
His face was pale as the moon in
daylight. His broad smile showed
teeth that Jack knew were false.</p>

<p>But the queerest thing about
him was his thick spectacles, so
heavily tinted with rose that Jack
could not see the eyes behind
them. The afternoon light seemed
to bounce off the lenses in such a
manner that no matter what angle
you looked at them, you could
not pierce them. And they curved
to hide the sides of his eyes completely.</p>

<p>Mister had explained that he
was an albino, and he needed the
glasses to dim the glare on his
eyes. Jack stopped being Uncas
for a minute to listen. He had
never seen an albino before, and,
indeed, he did not know what one
was.</p>

<p>"I don't mind the youngster,"
said Mister. "Let him play here
if he wants to. He's developing
his imagination, and he may be
finding more stimuli in this front
room than he could in all of outdoors.
We should never cripple
the fine gift of imagination in the
young. Imagination, fancy, fantasy&mdash;or
whatever you call it&mdash;is
the essence and mainspring
of those scientists, musicians,
painters, and poets who amount
to something in later life. They
are adults who have remained
youths."</p>

<p>Mister addressed Jack, "You're
the Last of the Mohicans, and
you're about to sneak up on the
French captain and tomahawk
him, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Jack blinked. He nodded his
head. The opaque rose lenses set
in Mister's face seemed to open a
door into his naked grey skull.</p>

<p>The man said, "I want you to
listen to me, Jack. You'll forget
my name, which isn't important.
But you will always remember
me and my visit, won't you?"</p>

<p>Jack stared at the impenetrable
lenses and nodded dumbly.</p>

<p>Mister turned to Jack's father.
"Let his fancy grow. It is a
necessary wish-fulfillment play.
Like all human young who are
good for anything at all, he is
trying to find the lost door to the
Garden of Eden. The history of
the great poets and men-of-action
is the history of the attempt to
return to the realm that Adam
lost, the forgotten Hesperides of
the mind, the Avalon buried in
our soul."</p>

<p>Mr. Crane put his fingertips
together. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Personally, I think that some
day man will realize just what he
is searching for and will invent a
machine that will enable the child
to project, just as a film throws
an image on a screen, the visions
in his psyche.</p>

<p>"I see you're interested," he
continued. "You would be,
naturally, since you're a professor
of philosophy. Now, let's call the
toy a specterscope, because
through it the subject sees the
spectres that haunt his unconscious.
Ha! Ha! But how does it
work? If you'll keep it to yourself,
Mr. Crane, I'll tell you something:
My native country's
scientists have developed a rather
simple device, though they haven't
published anything about it in the
scientific journals. Let me give
you a brief explanation: Light
strikes the retina of the eye; the
rods and cones pass on impulses
to the bipolar cells, which send
them on to the optic nerve, which
goes to the brain ..."</p>

<p>"Elementary and full of gaps,"
said Jack's father.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Mister. "A
bare outline should be enough.
You'll be able to fill in the details.
Very well. This specterscope
breaks up the light going into the
eye in such a manner that the
rods and cones receive only a
certain wavelength. I can't tell
you what it is, except that it's in
the visual red. The scope also
concentrates like a burning-glass
and magnifies the power of the
light.</p>

<p>"Result? A hitherto-undiscovered
chemical in the visual
purple of the rods is activated and
stimulates the optic nerve in a
way we had not guessed possible.
An electrochemical stimulus then
irritates the subconscious until it
fully wakes up.</p>

<p>"Let me put it this way. The
subconscious is not a matter of
location but of organization.
There are billions of possible
connections between the neurons
of the cortex. Look at those potentialities
as so many cards in
the same pack. Shuffle the cards
one way and you have the common
workaday <i>cogito, ergo sum</i>
mind. Reshuffle them, and, bingo!
you have the combination of
neurons, or cards, of the unconscious.
The specterscope does the
redealing. When the subject gazes
through it, he sees for the first
time the full impact and result
of his underground mind's workings
in other perspectives than
dreams or symbolical behavior.
The subjective Garden of Eden
is resurrected. It is my contention
that this specterscope will some
day be available to all children.</p>

<p>"When that happens, Mr.
Crane, you will understand that
the world will profit from man's
secret wishes. Earth will be a
far better place. Paradise, sunken
deep in every man, can be
dredged out and set up again."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Jack's
father, stroking his chin thoughtfully
with a finger. "Children like
my son are too introverted as it
is. Give them this psychological
toy you suggest, and you would
watch them grow, not into the
outside world, but into themselves.
They would fester. Man
has been expelled from the
Garden. His history is a long,
painful climb toward something
different. It is something that is
probably better than the soft and
flabby Golden Age. If man were
to return, he would regress, become
worse than static, become
infantile or even embryonic. He
would be smothered in the folds
of his own dreams."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the salesman.
"But I think you have a very unusual
child here. He will go much
farther than you may think. Why?
Because he is sensitive and has an
imagination that only needs the
proper guidance. Too many
children become mere bourgeois
ciphers with paunches and round
'O' minds full of tripe. They'll
stay on earth. That is, I mean
they'll be stuck in the mud."</p>

<p>"You talk like no insurance
salesman I've ever met."</p>

<p>"Like all those who really want
to sell, I'm a born psychologist,"
Mister shrilled. "Actually, I have
an advantage. I have a Ph.D. in
psychology. I would prefer staying
at home for laboratory work,
but since I can help my starving
children&mdash;I am not joking&mdash;so
much more by coming to a foreign
land and working at something
that will put food in their mouths,
I do it. I can't stand to see my
little ones go hungry. Moreover,"
he said with a wave of his long-fingered
hand, "this whole planet
is really a lab that beats anything
within four walls."</p>

<p>"You spoke of famine. Your
accent&mdash;your name. You're a
Greek, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"In a way," said Mister. "My
name, translated, means gracious
or kindly or well-meaning." His
voice became brisker. "The translation
is apropos. I'm here to do
you a service. Now, about these
monthly premiums ..."</p>

<p>Jack shook himself and stepped
out of the mold of fascination that
Mister's glasses seemed to have
poured around him. Uncas again,
he crawled on all fours from chair
to divan to stool to the fallen log
which the adults thought was an
easy chair. He stuck his head
from behind it and sighted along
the broomstick-musket at his
father. He'd shoot that white man
dead and then take his scalp. He
giggled at that, because his father
really didn't have any hairlock to
take.</p>

<p>At that moment Mister decided
to take off his specs and polish
them with his breast-pocket handkerchief.
While he answered one
of Mr. Crane's questions, he let
them dangle from his fingers. Accidentally,
the lenses were level
with Jack's gaze. One careless
glance was enough to jerk his eyes
back to them. One glance stunned
him so that he could not at once
understand that what he was seeing
was not reality.</p>

<p>There was his father across the
room. But it wasn't a room. It
was a space outdoors under the
low branch of a tree whose trunk
was so big it was as wide as the
wall had been. Nor was the
Persian rug there. It was replaced
by a close-cropped bright green
grass. Here and there foot-high
flowers with bright yellow petals
tipped in scarlet swayed beneath
an internal wind. Close to Mr.
Crane's feet a white horse no
larger than a fox terrier bit off
the flaming end of a plant.</p>

<p>All those things were wonderful
enough&mdash;but was that naked
giant who sprawled upon a moss-covered
boulder father? No! Yes!
Though the features were no
longer pinched and scored and
pale, though they were glowing
and tanned and smooth like a
young athlete's they were his
father's! Even the thick, curly
hair that fell down over a wide
forehead and the panther-muscled
body could not hide his identity.</p>

<p>Though it tore at his nerves,
and though he was afraid that
once he looked away he would
never again seize the vision, Jack
ripped his gaze away from the
rosy view.</p>

<p>The descent to the grey and
rasping reality was so painful that
tears ran down his cheeks, and he
gasped as if struck in the pit of
the stomach. How could beauty
like that be all around him without
his knowing it?</p>

<p>He felt that he had been blind
all his life until this moment and
would be forever eyeless again,
an unbearable forever, if he did
not look through the glass again.</p>

<p>He stole another hurried glance,
and the pain in his heart and
stomach went away, his insides
became wrapped in a soft wind.
He was lifted. He was floating, a
pale red, velvety air caressed him
and buoyed him.</p>

<p>He saw his mother run from
around the tree. That should have
seemed peculiar, because he had
thought she was dead. But there
she was, no longer flat-walking
and coughing and thin and wax-skinned,
but golden-brown and
curvy and bouncy. She jumped at
Daddy and gave him a long kiss.
Daddy didn't seem to mind that
she had no clothes on. Oh, it was
so wonderful. Jack was drifting
on a yielding and wine-tinted air
and warmed with a wind that
seemed to swell him out like a
happy balloon....</p>

<p>Suddenly he was falling, hurtling
helplessly and sickeningly
through a void while a cold and
drab blast gouged his skin and
spun him around and around. The
world he had always known
shoved hard against him. Again
he felt the blow in the solar plexus
and saw the grey tentacles of the
living reality reach for his heart.</p>

<p>Jack looked up at the stranger,
who was just about to put his
spectacles on the bridge of his
long nose. His eyelids were closed.
Jack never did see the pink eyes.</p>

<p>That didn't bother him. He had
other things to think about. He
crouched beside the chair while
his brain tried to move again, tried
to engulf a thought and failed because
it could not become fluid
enough to find the idea that would
move his tongue to shriek, <i>No!
No! No!</i></p>

<p>And when the salesman rose
and placed his papers in his case
and patted Jack on the head and
bent his opaque rose spectacles at
him and said good-by and that he
wouldn't be coming back because
he was going out of town to stay,
Jack was not able to move or say
a thing. Nor for a long time after
the door had closed could he
break through the mass that
gripped him like hardened lava.
By then, no amount of screams
and weeping would bring Mister
back. All his father could do was
to call a doctor who took the
boy's temperature and gave him
some pills.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Jack stood inside the wire and
bent his neck back to watch a
huge black and silver oyster feel
the dusk for a landing-field with
its single white foot and its orange
toes. Blindingly, lights sprang to
attention over the camp.</p>

<p>When Jack had blinked his eyes
back to normal, he could see over
the flat half-mile between the
fence and the ship. It lay quiet
and glittering and smoking in the
flood-beams. He could see the
round door in its side swing open.
Men began filing out. A truck
rumbled across the plain and
pulled up beside the metal bulk.
A very tall man stepped out of
the cab and halted upon the
running board, from which he
seemed to be greeting the newcomers
or giving them instructions.
Whatever he was saying
took so long that Jack lost interest.</p>

<p>Lately, he had not been able
to focus his mind for any length
of time upon anything except that
one event in the past. He
wandered around and whipped
glances at his comrades' faces,
noting listlessly that their uniforms
and shaved heads had improved
their appearance. But nothing
would be able to chill the feverishness
of their eyes.</p>

<p>Whistles shrilled. Jack jumped.
His heart beat faster. He felt as
if the end of the quest were suddenly
close. Somebody would be
around the corner. In a minute
that person would be facing him,
and then ...</p>

<p>Then, he reflected, and sagged
with a wave of disappointment at
the thought, then there was nobody
around the corner. It always
happened that way. Besides, there
weren't any corners in this camp.
He had reached the wall at the
end of the alley. Why didn't he
stop looking?</p>

<p>Sergeants lined the prisoners up
four abreast preparatory to
marching them into the barracks.
Jack supposed it was time to turn
in for the night. He submitted to
their barked orders and hard
hands without resentment. They
seemed a long way off. For the
ten thousandth time he was thinking
that this need not have happened.</p>

<p>If he had been man enough to
grapple with himself, to wrestle
as Jacob did with the angel and
not let loose until he had felled
the problem, he could be teaching
philosophy in a quiet little college,
as his father did. He had graduated
from high school with only
average marks, and then, instead
of going to college, as his father
had so much wanted him to, he
had decided he would work a
year. With his earnings, he would
see the world.</p>

<p>He had seen it, but when his
money ran out he had not returned
home. He had drifted,
taking jobs here and there, sleeping
in flop-houses, jungles, park
benches, and freight cars.</p>

<p>When the newly created Bureau
of Health and Sanity had frozen
jobs in an effort to solve the
transiency problem, Jack had refused
to work. He knew that he
would not be able to quit a job
without being arrested at once.
Like hundreds of thousands of
other youths, he had begged and
stolen and hidden from the local
police and the Bohas.</p>

<p>Even through all those years of
misery and wandering, he had not
once admitted to himself the true
nature of this fog-cottoned grail.
He knew it, and he did not know
it. It was patrolling the edge of
his mind, circling a far-off
periphery, recognizable by a crude
silhouette but nameless. Any
time he wanted to, he could have
summoned it closer and said, <i>You
are it, and I know you, and I
know what I am looking for. It
is...? Is what? Worthless?
Foolish? Insane? A dream?</i></p>

<p>Jack had never had the courage
to take that action. When it
seemed the thing was galloping
closer, charging down upon him,
he ran away. It must stay on the
horizon, moving on, always moving,
staying out of his grasp.</p>

<p>"All you guys, for'ard 'arch!"</p>

<p>Jack did not move. The truck
from the rocket had come through
a gate and stopped by the transies,
and about fifty men were getting
off the back.</p>

<p>The man behind Jack bumped
into him. Jack paid him no attention.
He did not move. He
squinted at the group who had
come from the rocket. They were
very tall, hump-shouldered, and
dressed in light grey-green Palm
Beach suits and tan Panama hats.
Each held a brown leather briefcase
at the end of a long, thin
arm. Each wore on the bridge of
his long nose a pair of rose-colored
glasses.</p>

<p>A cry broke hoarsely from the
transies. Some of those in front
of Jack fell to their knees as if a
sudden poison had paralyzed their
legs. They called names and
stretched out open hands. A boy
by Jack's side sprawled face-down
on the sand while he uttered over
and over again, "Mr. Pelopoeus!
Mr. Pelopoeus!"</p>

<p>The name meant nothing to
Jack. He did feel repulsed at
seeing the fellow turn on his side,
bend his neck forward, bring his
clenched fists up against his chest,
and jackknife his legs against his
arms. He had seen it many times
before in the transie jungles, but
he had never gotten over the sickness
it had first caused him.</p>

<p>He turned away and came almost
nose to nose with one of
the men from the rocket. He had
put down his briefcase so it rested
against his leg and taken a white
handkerchief out of his breast
pocket to wipe the dust from his
lenses. His lids were squeezed
shut as if he found the lights unbearable.</p>

<p>Jack stared and could not move
while a name that the boy behind
him had been crying out slowly
worked its way through his consciousness.
Suddenly, like the
roar of a flashflood that is just
rounding the bend of a dry gulch,
the syllables struck him. He
lunged forward and clutched at
the spectacles in the man's hand.
At the same time he yelled over
and over the words that had filled
out the blank in his memory.</p>

<p>"Mr. Eumenes! Mr. Eumenes!"</p>

<p>A sergeant cursed and slammed
his fist into Jack's face. Jack fell
down, flat on his back. Though
his jaw felt as if it were torn
loose from its hinge, he rolled
over on his side, raised himself
on his hands and knees, and
began to get up to his feet.</p>

<p>"Stand still!" bellowed the sergeant.
"Stay in formation or you'll
get more of the same!"</p>

<p>Jack shook his head until it
cleared. He crouched and held
out his hands toward the man,
but he did not move his feet.
Over and over, half-chanting,
half-crooning, he said, "Mr.
Eumenes! The glasses! Please,
Mr. Eumenes, the glasses!"</p>

<p>The forty-nine Mr. Eumenae-and-otherwise
looked incuriously
with impenetrable rosy eyes. The
fiftieth put the white handkerchief
back in his pocket. His mouth
opened. False teeth gleamed.
With his free hand he took off
his hat and waved it at the crowd
and bowed.</p>

<p>His tilted head showed a white
fuzzlike hair that shot up over
his pale scalp. His gestures were
both comic and terrifying. The
hat and the inclination of his
body said far more than words
could. They said, <i>Good-by forever,
and bon voyage!</i></p>

<p>Then Mr. Eumenes straightened
up and opened his lids.</p>

<p>At first, the sockets looked as
if they held no eyeballs, as if they
were empty of all but shadows.</p>

<p>Jack saw them from a distance.
Mr. Eumenes-or-his-twin was
shooting away faster and faster
and becoming smaller and smaller.
No! He himself was. He was
rocketing away within his own
body. He was falling down a
deep well.</p>

<p>He, Jack Crane, was a hollow
shaft down which he slipped and
screamed, away, away, from the
world outside. It was like seeing
from the wrong end of a pair of
binoculars that lengthened and
lengthened while the man with
the long-sought-for treasure in his
hand flew in the opposite direction
as if he had been connected
to the horizon by a rubber band
and somebody had released it and
he was flying towards it, away
from Jack.</p>

<p>Even as this happened, as he
knew vaguely that his muscles
were locking into the posture of
a beggar, hands out, pleading,
face twisted into an agony of
asking, lips repeating his croon-chant,
he saw what had occurred.</p>

<p>The realization was like the
sudden, blinding, and at the same
time clarifying light that sometimes
comes to epileptics just as
they are going into a seizure. It
was the thought that he had kept
away on the horizon of his mind,
the thought that now charged in
on him with long leaps and bounds
and then stopped and sat on its
haunches and grinned at him
while its long tongue lolled.</p>

<p>Of course, he should have
known all these years what it was.
He should have known that Mr.
Eumenes was the worst thing in
the world for him. He had known
it, but, like a drug addict, he had
refused to admit it. He had
searched for the man. Yet he
had known it would be fatal to
find him. The rose-colored spectacles
would swing gates that
should never be fully open. And
he should have guessed <i>what</i> and
<i>who</i> Mr. Eumenes was when that
encyclopedic fellow in the truck
had singsonged those names.</p>

<p>How could he have been so
stupid? Stupid? It was easy! He
had <i>wanted</i> to be stupid! And
how could the Mr. Eumenes-or-otherwise
have used such obvious
giveaway names? It was a measure
of their contempt for the humans
around them and of their own
grim wit. Look at all the double
entendres the salesman had given
his father, and his father had
never suspected. Even the head
of the Bureau of Health and
Sanity had been terrifyingly blas&eacute;
about it.</p>

<p>Dr. Vespa. He had thrown his
name like a gauntlet to humanity,
and humanity had stared idiotically
at it and never guessed its
meaning. Vespa was a good
Italian name. Jack didn't know
what it meant, but he supposed
that it had the same meaning as
the Latin. He remembered it from
his high school class.</p>

<p>As for his not encountering the
salesman until now, he had been
lucky. If he had run across him
during his search, he would have
been denied the glasses, as now.
And the shock would have made
him unable to cry out and betray
the man. He would have done
what he was so helplessly doing
at this moment, and he would
have been carted off to an institution.</p>

<p>How many other transies had
seen that unforgettable face on
the streets, the end of their search,
and gone at once into that state
that made them legal prey of the
Bohas?</p>

<p>That was almost his last
rational thought. He could no
longer feel his flesh. A thin red
curtain was falling between him
and his senses. Everywhere it
billowed out beneath him and
eased his fall. Everywhere it
swirled and softened the outlines
of things that were streaking by&mdash;a
large tree that he remembered
seeing in his living room, a naked
giant, his father, leaning against
it and eating an apple, and a
delicate little white creature
cropping flowers.</p>

<p>Yet all this while he lived in
two worlds. One was the passage
downwards towards the Garden
of Eden. The other was that
hemisphere in which he had dwelt
so reluctantly, the one he now
perceived through the thickening
red veil of his sight and other
senses.</p>

<p>They were not yet gone. He
could feel the hands of the black-clad
officers lifting him up and
laying him upon some hard
substance that rocked and
dumped. Every lurch and thud
was only dimly felt. Then he was
placed upon something softer and
carried into what he vaguely
sensed was the interior of one of
the barracks.</p>

<p>Some time later&mdash;he didn't
know or care when, for he had
lost all conception or even definition
of time&mdash;he looked up the
deep everlengthening shaft of himself
into the eyes of another Mr.
Eumenes or Mr. Sphex or Dr.
Vespa or whatever he called himself.
He was in white and wore
a stethoscope around his neck.</p>

<p>Beside him stood another of
his own kind. This one wore lipstick
and a nurse's cap. She carried
a tray on which were several
containers. One container held a
large and sharp scalpel. The
other held an egg. It was about
twice the size of a hen's egg.</p>

<p>Jack saw all this just before
the veil took on another shade of
red and blurred completely his
vision of the outside. But the
final thickening did not keep him
from seeing that Doctor Eumenes
was staring down at him as if he
were peering into a dusky burrow.
And Jack could make out the
eyes. They were large, much
larger than they should have been
at the speed with which Jack was
receding. They were not the pale
pink of an albino's. They were
black from corner to corner and
built of a dozen or so hexagons
whose edges caught the light.</p>

<p>They twinkled.</p>

<p>Like jewels.</p>

<p>Or the eyes of an enormous
and evolved wasp.</p>
